# Prerequisites

There are hardware and software prerequisites for participating in this CodeJam. There are also some optional, recommended items that you might like to have too.

## Hardware

Each participant should have their own laptop with enough admin privileges to be able to install software. You should also be able to access a command line shell (e.g. `cmd.exe` on Windows). The laptop should also be able to connect to the host organization's guest network for Internet access, and have enough power for the whole day.

## Software

There are some mandatory and optional requirements with respect to software.

### Mandatory

Before the CodeJam day, participants should ensure they have the following installed on their laptops:

- Chrome (latest version) : [https://www.google.com/chrome/](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- Visual Studio Code (also known as VS Code): [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Node.js : [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Postman : [https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/)
- SQLite : [https://sqlite.org/index.html](https://sqlite.org/index.html)

With regards to SQLite: if you are running macOS or Linux it's likely that you'll already have SQLite installed. For Windows users, please follow the installation instructions that are available (you may find this four-minute video useful: [Codible SQLite video 1: How to install sqlite (SQLite3) on windows 10 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOJWL3oXDO8)). After installation, please check you can start the SQLite executable (`sqlite3`) from the command line.

With regards to Node: we recommend the latest LTS (long term support) version. After installation, please check that you can start node from the command line, and also successfully install packages with the included `npm` command.

### Optional

While the software listed in the previous section is essential for exercises 1-9, you may also wish to install the following if you want to replicate the activities in exercise 10.

- git : [https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)
- Make (for Windows, see [Make for Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm))
- The Cloud Foundry command line tool cf : [https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html)
- The Multi-Target Application Cloud Foundry CLI Plugin (CF MTA Plugin) : [https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud)


## Attendees

Some familiarity with JavaScript is strongly recommended. Existing familiarity with Core Data Services (CDS) concepts is an advantage, as is experience with working with command line tools.

Each attendee should have an SAP Cloud Platform trial account, and specifically a Cloud Foundry environment with an organization and a space defined. See the [Getting started with Cloud Foundry](https://developers.sap.com/uk/tutorials/hcp-cf-getting-started.html) tutorial for more details.

Attendees wishing to prepare themselves for the day can take advantage of the tutorial [Create a Basic Node.js App](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-node-create-basic-app.html) in the SAP Developer Center.

## Recommendations

Further to the software prerequisites described above, we also recommend:

- The [JSON Formatter extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en) for Google Chrome
- The [XML Tree extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xml-tree/gbammbheopgpmaagmckhpjbfgdfkpadb) for Google Chrome
